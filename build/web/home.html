                        <p>Kartik was supposed to have a busy 2020 and all of his films were going to be sequels. His
                            Valentine’s Day release was the much-awaited Love Aaj Kal, which did not receive the same
                            appreciation as its namesake. This was to be followed by Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 that is still slated to
                            release in late July. The release date of Dostana 2 is not out yet but it could very well be pushed
                            to 2021, as the shooting has barely begun on the film.

                    Saavdhan and Gulabo Sitabo. While the sequel, which released in February, was one of the most loved

                        earlier December release of Bachchan Pandey has already been pushed to January 2021.</p>
