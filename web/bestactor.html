                <p>Ajay’s Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior was the highest-grossing film of the year before the COVID-19 shut
                    down theatres across the country. But Ajay’s Bhuj: The Pride of India is also slated to release this
                    year around August, followed by Maidaan, which will be out in December. Since there’s no official
                    announcement on the postponement of these films yet, we can only assume that the makers are sticking
                    to these release dates. We might also get a glimpse of Singham in Rohit Shetty‘s Sooryavanshi, when
                    it finally makes a release.</p>

                    <p>Varun began 2020 with Street Dancer 3, which did not perform as well as it was expected to. But his
                        next venture – the remake of Coolie No. 1 – reunites him with Daddy Dhawan, a collaboration that has
                        worked well in the past. The film was slated to hit theatres in May and the makers have not
                        announced a new release date yet. Varun will also be seen in Rannbhoomi this year, which is slated
                        to hit theatres in November.

                        <p>Kartik was supposed to have a busy 2020 and all of his films were going to be sequels. His
                            Valentine’s Day release was the much-awaited Love Aaj Kal, which did not receive the same
                            appreciation as its namesake. This was to be followed by Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 that is still slated to
                            release in late July. The release date of Dostana 2 is not out yet but it could very well be pushed
                            to 2021, as the shooting has barely begun on the film.

                    Saavdhan and Gulabo Sitabo. While the sequel, which released in February, was one of the most loved

                        reopen. Akshay was also to have an Eid release with Laxmmi Bomb, which rumors suggest might directly
                        release on an OTT platform. The biopic Prithviraj is still slated to release in November, while the
                        earlier December release of Bachchan Pandey has already been pushed to January 2021.</p>
